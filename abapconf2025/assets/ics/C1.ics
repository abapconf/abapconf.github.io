DESCRIPTION:Embarking on an S/4HANA migration with a mountain of custom ABA
	P code? This discussion offers a fresh perspective on turning that challen
	ge into an opportunity to build a clean\, maintainable core. Youâ€™ll discov
	er practical strategies and paradigms to reduce technical debt\, embrace m
	odern tools and frameworks like CDS\, RAP\, and Fiori elements\, and autom
	ate your way to a healthier codebase.  Going from a high level and down to
	 details\, we will explore together how the wisdom of the past\, with the 
	technology of the future\, can be combined to make something great.
