DESCRIPTION:A look outside the SAP bubble. How are others doing it? What ca
	n we learn from them? Or is the SAP world the best? This talk wants to dis
	cuss the topics that might influence our future as SAP developers. What sh
	ould be adopt\, what are we doing better? If you look outside\, you'll rea
	lise that the IT world is more than just reports. While some of the most s
	uccessfull companies in the world are using SAP\, the inovovation they dri
	ve has nothing to do with SAP. Be it UX\, mobile\, internet of things or n
	ow AI: these trends came from the outside. What does this mean for us as S
	AP developers? Adopt or be obsolete? Or is it them that should start liste
	ning and learn from us?
