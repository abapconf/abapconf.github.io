        "longBio": "I have a long background on several SAP topics. Learned SAP and ABAP in 1998 and since then focused on the intersection between SAP backend transactions and the user that works with them to bring benefits to the company. As the SAP customer is in the end the one that pays to use SAP, my focus is on helping customers to get the best out of SAP software. Be it with bringin the best UX to them, or by architecting timeless solutions that combine the best of several worlds. I lived in Brazil for 11 years and I learned there that SAP sells a global product, and that their programming tools are like a lingua franca for SAP professionals around the world.",

                "abstract": "CDS Views sind der zentrale Baustein im neuen Programmiermodell der SAP. Sie ermöglichen es mit syntaktischen Mitteln wie den Assoziationen, die Modellierung des Datenmodells weitgehend auf die Datenbankebene zu verschieben und dank der Annotationen auch viele semantische Informationen in den Views selbst zu hinterlegen. Dieses reiche Datenmodell bietet eine sehr gute Grundlage für die automatisierte Verarbeitung dieser Informationen in Frameworks wie beispielsweise dem RESTful ABAP Programming Model (RAP) oder Fiori Elements. In diesem Vortrag möchte ich einen Ansatz präsentieren, um in der klassischen SAP GUI automatische Listreports mit ALV auf Basis der CDS Views zu generieren. Die CDS-Annotationen werden dabei analog zu Fiori Elements ausgewertet, die generierten Reports können somit als Vorgänger zukünftiger Fiori Apps fungieren und die Transition unterstützen, indem sie den Anwendern Programme zur Verfügung stellen, die den „Look“ der SAP GUI mit dem „Feel“ der neuen Fiori-Anwendungen zusammenbringen."

However, many of these exit points are common to multiple business areas, and having code belonging to different internal teams in this central/common point creates dependencies, transport locking, high testing efforts, and plethora of other problems in general. At Microsoft, we developed a custom ABAP Framework, called 'Service Isolation Framework (SIF)', which uses dynamic programming to evaluate based on available context variables, AND, based on rules specified in a custom configuration table (Hierarchical Cluster view) to identify the service line/business area, and then use OO-ABAP / Custom BADIs to route the execution flow to development objects under specific team ownership, result in breaking of un-necessary dependencies between teams, avoiding transport object locks, and minimizing the need for massive testing. Furthermore, it also allows performance measures and getting insights on areas of improvement to act on."

We will discuss the advantages of application development using open source as well as the challenges it presents.\nThe session will highlight the urgent need for revitalization of the ABAP ecosystem. See how open source will provide the necessary booster shots. Learn about topics like semantic versions, the publication and discovery of packages, and dependency management.\nOpen source will change how we work with ABAP forever. The sharing of high-quality ABAP packages will enable a strategic shift - moving away from reliance on inadequately documented and unreleased SAP code, to modular, thoroughly tested components build by the community. This approach ultimately aids moving custom-developments to the cloud with greater ease.\nLet's make ABAP cool again: Open Source ABAP. Join the Movement."

Zuerst werden wir das Coding unter Test setzen mit einigen gezielten Unit Tests. Natürlich gibt es dafür ein paar Hindernisse, die wir überwinden müssen. Dann, mit der hinzugewonnenen Sicherheit durch die Tests, werden wir das Coding klarer und strukturierter machen. Denn darum geht es: Verständlichkeit.

Das meist unter Projektdruck der eh schon komplexen S/4-Projekte. Die Chance robustere Anwendungen\nmit automatisierten Unit- und Integrationstests zu bauen gerät dann schnell ins Hintertreffen.\nDabei hat man doch gerade im Zuge von S/4-Migration und der Implementierung neuer Anwendungen mit neusten Frameworks die Chance wenigstens\nein paar Qualitätsziele umzusetzen.\nDie Hemmschwelle muss gar nicht so groß sein wie vielleicht angenommen. Man lässt sich doch schnell abschrecken obwohl es mittlerweile immer mehr Möglichkeiten gibt.\nDieser Vortrag richtet sich nicht an Testexperten, sondern an Einsteiger, die im Zuge von S/4 oder Steampunk in die RAP-Entwicklung einsteigen und mit einfachen mitteln\n ihre Services 'smoke testen' wollen. D.h. einfache Tests ohne großen Aufwand aber mit einer gewissen grundlegenden Testabdeckung.\nPraxisnah pragmatisch, denn jeder Test ist besser als kein Test.\n\nTeil des Vortrages sind Unit-Tests einer Behaviour Implementation (Determinations, Validations und Actions) mit Hilfe des Test Double Frameworks und\neinfache Integrationstests für OData."

                "abstract": "In Booking last year payments visibility became for us one of core goals. Being SOA environment we have plenty of services calling SAP via integration platform like Mulesoft. We have reviewed - how can we see end-to-end traces from the caller to the end document as a single span tree. I have explored available options and found several possible solutions. One of solutions - is telemetry implementation by Lars Hvam exposing data in protobuf format.\nTechnically it's a right thing to do - all code in ABAP, direct integration. But practically HTTP calls on a scale appeared to be a problem. Using AMC to expose events from ABAP sessions also failed - we were stuck with 'Handshake' lock. So we looked at native abap capabilities to allow processes to stream events with minimal costs and it appeared that MQTT protocol fits the best and our performance tests showed exceptional performance comparing to HTTP calls. Another point is a message serialization. Identity JSON transformation is significantly faster that custom-bult procedures and doesn't require support.\nSo at the end our solution consists of:\n- ABAP SDK allowing to create traces, spans, raise span events and streaming them using MQTT in JSON format ( also supports plugins, so it's very extendable )\n- NodeJS proxy service which is coupled with a format produced by ABAP Trace SDK, proxying messages via MQTT to telemetry providers ( Honeycomb in our case )\nMay be in future we will consider also usage of a message broker, such as event Mesh. Currently I'm working on more general use case of streaming not only telemetry , but also Kafka events from SAP using similar approach. We consider currently Solace as our target environment for PoC"

With this slideset, every developer will be able to to understand cloud ready development find the right technology for their development based on their requirements.<br>I will present an open source tool that I am currently working on, which provides an overview of all existing extensions of an S/4HANA system. Currently it only consists of the basic functionality (objects, transports and developers + class diagrams and relationships between CDS views), but by the time of the talk it will provide a more extensive overview of the relationships between development objects."
