DESCRIPTION:Hierarchy Support in RAP\nThe aggregation extension of the OData V4 protocol has recently been extended to support the query of recursive hierarchies with the help of hierarchy transformations:\n\nhttps://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-data-aggregation-ext/v4.0/csd04/odata-data-aggregation-ext-v4.0-csd04.html#HierarchicalTransformations\n\nThe RAP Runtime Engine (https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-restful-application-programming-model/runtime-frameworks#rap-runtime-engine) and UI5 are now supporting these new $apply transformations to query hierarchy views and display the data in tree tables.\n\nThis session should give a short introduction into the topic, show how hierarchy scenarios can be built with RAP and consumed in Fiori, and which features are available.\n
