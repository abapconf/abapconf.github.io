        "shortBio": "Seasoned SAP Consultant with focus on UX. Helps global companies to get the best out of SAP software. My interest is not solely ABAP, I like to look accrosss the horizont to see what others are using and how this can be incorporated in a SAP solution.",
        "longBio": "I have a long background on several SAP topics. Learned SAP and ABAP in 1998 and since then focused on the intersection between SAP backend transactions and the user that works with them to bring benefits to the company. As the SAP customer is in the end the one that pays to use SAP, my focus is on helping customers to get the best out of SAP software. Be it with bringin the best UX to them, or by architecting timeless solutions that combine the best of several worlds. I lived in Brazil for 11 years and I learned there that SAP sells a global product, and that their programming tools are like a lingua franca for SAP professionals around the world.",
